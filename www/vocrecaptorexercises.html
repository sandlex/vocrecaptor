                                for last 7 words. Each cycle includes 7 exercises in this order: Cards, Definition guessing, Writing, 
                                Definition choosing, Translation guessing, Translation choosing and Mosaic.<br>To stop exercising and go back to

                                At the left-hand column there are words arranged randomly, at the right-hand column - translations. You have to match all the pairs by pressing
                                the buttons from the opposite columns. Choose the word from, for instance, the left column and press the button. 
                                Now you have to choose the word, in this case a translation, from the opposite column and press the button. If you've chosen the pair correctly - the pair 
                                will disappear<br><br>
                                After you do all the exercises for current group of word you'll start do it again for the next group. If you've just finished the last group
                                you'll go back to account panel where you can choose another dictionary to play with.
